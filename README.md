# Rutgers Course Sniper

### Course sniper for RU written in Python, utilizing Pushover for Push Notifications

### Why?
---
I made this in the span of an hour because why not. 
Why use someone else's program when I could make my own shittier version?

### Usage
---
I have a cronjob on my home server running this script every 2 seconds and it notifies me if a class opens up. For now usage is pretty limited, add the index of the class you wanna snipe, line by line, into a file called indexes.md and place it in the src folder. Then find a computer that can run this script at whatever interval you'd like.
